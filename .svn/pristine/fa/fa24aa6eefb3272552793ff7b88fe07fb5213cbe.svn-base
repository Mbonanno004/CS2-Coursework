1. Which function took the longest?
    1) Bubble sort function, 35 seconds
    2) operator [], 25 seconds

2. Why did this function take the longest?
    1) Bubble sort took the longest at 35 seconds. Even though the function for the bubble sort is only called once,
    it has to loop itself over and over reordering the vector until it's finished sorting. which can be very taxing depending on the 
    size of whatever it is sorting.
    
    2) the operator[] took the second longest because it is used within the loops of the bubble sort function.
