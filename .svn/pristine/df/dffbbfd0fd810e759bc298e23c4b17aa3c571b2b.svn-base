// Memory allocation and array bounds checking
//
// C/C++ does not check array bounds, so accessing an element of an
//    array outside of its defined size results in Undefined Behavior
//
// TO COMPILE: clang++ -Wall array_bounds_check.cpp -o bounds_check
// TO RUN: ./bounds_check
//           Then enter a postivie integer value at the prompt
//
// Instructions:
//   Read the code.
//   Run the program on wasp/hornet (multiple) times.
//   Try these values of 10, 16, 32, 33, 40
//
//   Read over the output each time.
//
//      What is wrong with the output?
// str1 only has 5 spots in it's array. However the ouput shows str1 having as many slots as whatever you input for n.
// This is not the case though. Because of this, when you type in 32, 33, and 40 you actully begin to reach the str2 on the heap
// and begin writing to it, rather than actually writing to str1.
//      What is wrong with the code?
// The sizes of both the new arrays str1 and str2 are both set before any n value is read in
//      Why is no error raised?
// The array's are stored on the heap, because of how c++ is setup the compiler won't do any optimization on the heap.
// So it can't give any errors in that case. So you'd have to investigate the heap for the errors yourself.
//      How many bytes are between the start of str1 and str2?
// There would be 32 bytes between str1 and str2, that's why when you type in 33 in the value for n in the program
// you actually begin writing to str2, because you've actually reached to that point in the heap where str2 is stored.
//      How can you test for this logical error?
// You can run valgrind to check if there are any memory problems in your program. Specifically for this program though
// doing some type of test on the bounds of the new arrays you make could tell you if you'll run into an error.
//      How can you prevent this type of error?
// By checking bounds and keeping within those bounds in your code
//      Include the delete[] at the end and recompile, what changes?
// At a certain size n you gett a message at the end of the code saying free(): invalid size Aborted (core dumped).
