1. Which function took the longest?
    Bubble sort

2. Why did this function take the longest?
    Bubble sort took the longest because bubble sort is a recursive function with the O notation of O(n^2),
    because of this even though the function for the bubble sort is only called once. it has to recursively call over
    itself until it's finished.
